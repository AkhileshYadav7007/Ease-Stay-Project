# Ease-Stay-Project

Hotel Administer (superuser or top-level admin per hotel group) can:

Perform CRUD on Hotels

Create Hotel Managers (with login credentials)

Hotel Managers (per individual hotel) can:

Perform CRUD on Rooms, Bookings, Pricing for their assigned hotel

B2C Users can:

Browse hotels, search/filter rooms, and book them


üí° Use Case: Bargaining Feature
üîÑ Workflow:
User selects a room and clicks ‚ÄúNegotiate Price‚Äù.

User submits an offer (e.g., ‚Çπ1800 instead of ‚Çπ2000).

Hotel Manager gets notified and can:

Accept the offer (user books at the new price)

Reject the offer (user sees rejection)

Counter offer (e.g., ‚Çπ1900 ‚Üí user accepts/rejects)

If accepted, user proceeds to booking with the agreed price.
